# Rock Cannon - Tracker App
### ICE-2002 Industrial Projects

```
EvoMetric Projects | Rock Cannons Tracker Application
Rock cannons are historic features found largely in the slate quarrying regions of
north-west Wales. They consist of natural rock or boulders into which a sequence of
holes has been drilled; traditionally these holes were partly filled with black powder
and ignited in succession as part of local celebrations or national events, producing
a series of loud bangs and flashes. Up to 235 separate rock cannon sites have been
documented across Gwynedd alone, with hole counts ranging from just a few to nearly
200 per site. These installations were often used to mark significant dates, visits by
dignitaries, or other communal festivities in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Building on this intriguing cultural and industrial-archaeological heritage described in
Griff R. Jones’s The Rock Cannon of Gwynedd (2002), the Rock Cannon Tracker project aims
to develop a web and mobile application that enables enthusiasts, historians, hikers,
and local communities to report, locate, and share information about rock cannon sites.
Core Features

• User Reporting: Allow users to submit new rock cannon discoveries with GPS
coordinates, photographs, and descriptive metadata such as number of holes,
dates and times visited, and local narratives about the feature.
• Interactive Map: A responsive world-view map that displays documented rock
cannon sites and allows users to filter by region, number of holes, or historical
details to that specific rock-cannon location.
• Site Pages: Each cannon listing will include submitted photos, a name or identifier,
hole count, location details, and a timeline of notable events and user comments.
• Directions & Navigation: Integration with mapping APIs to provide turn-by-turn
directions to rock cannon sites, making them easier to find for field visits.
• Photo Gallery: A gallery view per site to showcase crowd-sourced images from
different visits and seasons.
• Search & Sorting: Tools to search by date recorded, hole count, or proximity to the
user’s chosen location.

Additional marks will be awarded for novel functionality, such as the automatic
integration of findings into social media platforms to raise awareness of rock cannons
as cultural and historical features of North Wales, thereby supporting increased interest
and tourism in the region.
